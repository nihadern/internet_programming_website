            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a senior Computer Science major with a minor in math. 
              I was born in India and grew up in India, Atlanta, Congo, and a 
              few other countries shortly. 
              I enjoy traveling, soccer, and learning new languages. 
              Here are some of the languages I had an oppertunity learn 
              (I have lost proficiency in many of them over the years):
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Malayalam</li>
                <li>French</li>
                <li>Arabic</li>
                <li>English</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              I transferred to KSU from Florida Tech as I changed my major from 
              aerospace engineering to computer science. 
              I am currently contracting part time for Magmutual and before that
               I used to tutor Math at the SMART center here at KSU. 
            </p>
            <h2>Academic interests</h2>
            <p>
              I have always been interested in Math and Computer Science. 
              I recently finished my Math minor and I am on track to finish my
               Computer Sceince major in 2020.
              I plan to go to graduate school but have not yet decided if I want
               to follow software engineering or data science.
              I enjoy coding in a few languages, here is a list in order of 
              preference:
              <ol>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>C</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p> 
              I think it is important to engage in activties that further my 
              education out of class.
              Since starting university, I have always been engaged in a 
              competition team. 
              Currently, I am the control systems lead for the Aerial Robotics 
              Competition Team at KSU.
              I am responsible for developing autonomous speech recognition 
              systems and researching on-board detection and classiﬁcation of 
              objects for competitions like International Aerial Robotics 
              Competition (IARC), SAE Aero Design competitions, and AUVSI SUAS. 
              I successfully tested and integrated oﬄine DeepSpeech speech 
              recognition module for IARC.
              Most importantly I enjoy working with a team to solve difficult 
              problems.
            </p>
            <p> 
              I am also currently working part time with a team at Magmutual 
              performing data analytics on the claim data they have.
              This was a continuation of the work we did for Hackathon for the 
              same company. 
              During the Hackathon, we placed ﬁrst in the competition for 
              deriving insights about risk factors from a large dataset of 
              medical insurance claims with a team of three. 
              Python and data visualization libraries, like matplotlib and 
              pyplot, were used to analyze and visualize the data. Proposed a
               methodology to use natural language processing deep neural 
               networks to ﬁll in missing data and to help categorize data 
               for identifying risk factors.
